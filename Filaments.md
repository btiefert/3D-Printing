Filaments
=========

My experience with various filaments.

Favorites
---------

eSun PLA+ - Very easy to print with @ 200ºC, minimal warping. Layers
sometimes don't adhere strongly, which could probably be solved with
a slightly higher printing temperature. Slightly expensive, $23/kg.

Monoprice PLA+

Mika3D Metallic PLA - Easy to print with @ 185ºC, no issues at all.
Filament is slightly stretchy/spongy when warm, but this hasn't affected
print quality. Pricey ($40 for a 3-pack of 1/2 kg spools, i.e. $27/kg)

Anycubic PLA


Good

AIO Robotics (1/2 kg spool)

Tianse

Comgrow/Creality


Avoid
-----

Eryone PLA - Lots of warping of corners off the bed, fairly melty/globby
printing @ 185ºC.


TBD

Anycubic PETG - Having a lot of difficulty printing with it.

Overture - New spool, still evaluating.
